## Abstract
this is the 2025 Geonovum testbed sensordata report. It contains the results of Geonovums investigation into OGC sensordata standards. This was done with market participation, after a tender three parties were selected to invistigate one research question each:

* Nelen & Schuurmans investigated Communicating with a Collection of sensors

* Mindloops investigated Visualization & Analysis

* Fraunhofer IOSB investigated initial device registration.

This report contains their detailed findings. Geonovum started this testbed to learn more about the applicability of OGC sensordata standards to the Dutch public sector. Now that the testbed has concluded it the posibility of making one or more of these standards mandatory seems feasable, however there are some findings that need further investigation. Important points to be adressed are mapping the internal data model of local vendors to the Observations Measurements and Sampling based model of the OGC standards. As well as gaining more experience in client usecases. For Initial device registration a viable and efficient solution was shown, further experiments with sensors from Dutch stakeholders are a next step. Finally before taking further steps towards a mandatory standard, Geonovum will consult with Dutch public sector stakeholders over the outcome of this testbed.
