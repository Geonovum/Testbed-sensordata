## Abstract
This is the 2025 Geonovum testbed sensordata report. It contains the results of Geonovum's investigation into OGC sensordata standards. This was done with market participation. Using a public tender process, three parties were selected to investigate one research question each:

* Nelen & Schuurmans investigated Communicating with a Collection of sensors

* Mindloops investigated Visualization & Analysis

* Fraunhofer IOSB investigated initial device registration.

This report contains their detailed findings. Geonovum started this testbed to learn more about the applicability of OGC sensordata standards in the Dutch public sector. Now that the testbed has concluded, the possibility of making one or more of these standards mandatory seems feasable, although there are some findings that need further investigation. An important point to be addressed is the mapping of the internal data model of local vendors to the Observations, Measurements and Samples based model of the OGC standards. Also, there is a need for gaining more experience in client use cases. For Initial device registration a viable and efficient solution was shown, which may eventually be proposed as an extension to the OGC standards; further experiments with sensors from Dutch stakeholders are a next step. Finally, before taking further steps towards a mandatory standard, Geonovum will consult with Dutch public sector stakeholders on the outcome of this testbed.
